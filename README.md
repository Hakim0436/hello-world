# hello-world
Getting accustomed to github.

My introduction to programming started as an electrical engineering student at the University of Memphis. I learned Fortran, MatLab, C, C++, and HTML. While attending, I worked as a Helpdesk Technician at the University, and later I worked as a Helpdesk Tech for Stream International. Stream was an outsourced helpdesk company for different computer brands such as Dell, and the now extinct Gateway computers. 

I was offered a higher paying job as a electrical substation operator, and I put my education on hold for two years to work, and get married. I later earned an Associate degree in engineering from Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis, TN since I needed only 4 classes to get it, and 2 of them were online courses. I just wanted some sort of degree to account for my time in school. I continued programming as a hobby. I learned CSS, and Javascript on my own. I moved up in the electric utility industry. I'm currently working as a Transmission Systems Operator, with a Reliability Coordinator certification(the highest authority on the Bulk Electric System of North America), and I finished a Bachelor degree in Economics. 

I chose economics because the program was cheap, it was online (there were no reasonably priced electrical engineering classes that I could take online that were accredited), it took into account all of the extra math classes I had taken (Calc I, II, III, Diff. Eq, Linear Algebra, Math Proofs), and I felt it would help me if I wanted to move up to senior management. Strange enough, Economics introduced me to MySql, and R programming. I developed a stronger interest in programming, but I wasn't sure how I could transition into programming. I've continued programming mostly for fun. Hopefully I can turn my interest into a livelihood some day.
